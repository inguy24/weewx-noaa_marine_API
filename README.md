## Station Selection Guide

### Choosing Tide Stations

**Distance Matters**: Tide timing can vary significantly along a coastline
- **Within 20 miles**: Excellent accuracy for tide predictions
- **20-50 miles**: Good accuracy, minor timing differences
- **50+ miles**: Useful for general trends, timing may vary

**Station Types**: Look for stations with these capabilities
- **Water Level Observations**: Real-time current conditions
- **Tide Predictions**: Calculated high/low tide times
- **Water Temperature**: Available at selected coastal stations

**Multiple Station Strategy**: Select 2-3 stations for reliability
- **Primary**: Closest station with all desired data
- **Backup**: Alternative stations in case of outages or maintenance
- **Redundancy**: Marine stations occasionally go offline for equipment maintenance, severe weather, or technical issues

### Choosing Marine Weather Buoys

**Buoy Location Types**:
- **Coastal buoys** (< 50 miles offshore) - Local nearshore conditions
- **Offshore buoys** (> 50 miles offshore) - Open ocean conditions  
- **Deep water buoys** (> 200m depth) - True offshore marine weather
- **Great Lakes buoys** - Seasonal operation, typically April-November

**Data Considerations**:
- **Wave data**: Most accurate from deep water locations
- **Wind data**: Coastal buoys may be influenced by land effects
- **Temperature**: Sea surface temperature varies with depth and currents

**Backup Buoy Strategy**: Select multiple buoys for continuous coverage
- **Primary**: Closest buoy with required measurements  
- **Secondary**: Alternative buoy for data validation and backup
- **Seasonal**: Great Lakes buoys may be removed during ice season

**Station Maintenance Periods**: 
Marine monitoring equipment requires regular maintenance. NOAA typically schedules:
- **Routine maintenance**: 2-4 times per year per station
- **Equipment upgrades**: May cause extended outages
- **Weather-related**: Severe storms can damage or disable equipment

**Reconfiguration Options**:
```bash
# Reconfigure station and field selection anytime
sudo weectl extension reconfigure marine_data

# View current station status and selection
sudo weectl extension show marine_data
```

## Configuration Examples

### Coastal Monitoring Setup
Perfect for harbors, beaches, and coastal activities:
```
Selected Stations:
- Tide Station: Newport Harbor, RI (5.2 miles)
- Marine Buoy: Block Island, RI (12.8 miles)

Selected Fields:
- Current water level and tide predictions
- Wave height and sea surface temperature  
- Marine wind speed and direction
```

### Offshore Fishing Setup
Optimized for offshore conditions and fishing:
```  
Selected Stations:
- Tide Station: Point Judith, RI (8.1 miles)

- Sea surface temperature and marine winds
- Barometric pressure trends
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Marine Data Appearing

**Check station connectivity:**
```bash
# Test your selected stations
sudo -u weewx python3 /usr/share/weewx/user/marine_data.py --test-api
```

**Verify configuration:**
- Station IDs are correct and active
- Selected fields are supported by your stations
- Network connectivity to NOAA APIs

### Intermittent Data Gaps

Marine monitoring stations occasionally go offline for maintenance or due to weather conditions. This is normal.

**What the extension does automatically:**
- Logs station outages and data gaps
- Continues collecting from available backup stations
- Resumes data collection when stations come back online

**When to take action:**
- Gaps longer than 6-12 hours may indicate station issues
- Check [NOAA CO-OPS Station Status](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stations.html) 
- Check [NDBC Buoy Status](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/)

### High API Usage Warnings

The extension monitors your daily API usage to stay within NOAA's reasonable use policies.

**Reduce usage by:**
- Selecting fewer fields or stations
- Increasing update intervals in configuration
- Choosing "minimal" field selection during reconfiguration

**Current usage:** Check your WeeWX logs for daily API usage summaries.

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstallation

```bash
# Remove the extension completely
sudo weectl extension uninstall marine_data

# Restart WeeWX
sudo systemctl restart weewx
```

**Note**: Uninstallation removes the service and configuration but preserves your collected marine data in the database.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Installation Problems:**
- Ensure WeeWX 5.1+ is installed: `weectl --version`
- Check Python version: `python3 --version` (3.7+ required)
- Verify internet connectivity for station discovery
- Check permissions: installer must run as root/sudo

**Station Discovery Issues:**
- **No stations found**: Increase search radius or check coastal proximity
- **Station unavailable**: Some stations may be temporarily offline - select backups
- **Invalid coordinates**: Verify WeeWX station location in configuration

**Data Collection Issues:**
- **No marine data appearing**: Check service status and API connectivity
- **Intermittent data gaps**: Normal for marine stations during maintenance
- **High API usage**: Reduce selected fields or increase collection intervals

**Database Issues:**
- **Field creation errors**: Check WeeWX database write permissions
- **Missing data columns**: Re-run installer or create fields manually
- **Database conflicts**: Avoid installing over existing marine field modifications

### Log Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor WeeWX logs for marine data activity
sudo journalctl -u weewx -f | grep -i marine

# Check for successful data collection
sudo journalctl -u weewx -f | grep "Marine.*collected"

# Monitor for errors and warnings
sudo journalctl -u weewx -f | grep -i "error\|warning" | grep -i marine
```

### Debug Configuration

Enable detailed logging in `weewx.conf`:

```ini
[MarineDataService]
    log_success = true
    log_errors = true

[Logging]
    [[loggers]]
        [[[user.marine_data]]]
            level = DEBUG
```

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Test installation and service registration
PYTHONPATH=/usr/share/weewx:/etc/weewx/bin/user python3 /usr/share/weewx/user/marine_data.py --test-install

# Test station connectivity and API access
PYTHONPATH=/usr/share/weewx:/etc/weewx/bin/user python3 /usr/share/weewx/user/marine_data.py --test-api

# Run comprehensive system tests
PYTHONPATH=/usr/share/weewx:/etc/weewx/bin/user python3 /usr/share/weewx/user/marine_data.py --test-all
```

### Manual Database Field Creation

If automatic field creation fails, create fields manually:

```bash
# Create marine data fields manually
weectl database add-column marine_current_water_level --type REAL -y
weectl database add-column marine_next_high_time --type INTEGER -y
weectl database add-column marine_wave_height --type REAL -y
weectl database add-column marine_sea_surface_temp --type REAL -y

# Restart WeeWX after manual field creation
sudo systemctl restart weewx
```

### Station Status Checking

When experiencing data gaps, check official NOAA station status:

- **CO-OPS Stations**: [NOAA Tides & Currents](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stations.html)
- **NDBC Buoys**: [National Data Buoy Center](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/)

Look for status indicators and recent data timestamps to verify station operation.

## API Usage Management

### Understanding API Usage

The extension automatically monitors daily API usage to stay within NOAA's reasonable use policies:

**API Call Estimates:**
- **Minimal Configuration**: ~150 calls/day (conservative)
- **Standard Configuration**: ~400 calls/day (typical) 
- **Custom Configuration**: Varies based on field selection

**Current Usage Monitoring:**
Check your WeeWX logs for daily API usage summaries:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u weewx | grep "Marine.*API usage"
```

### Optimizing API Usage

**Reduce usage by:**
- Selecting fewer stations (choose 1-2 primary stations)
- Using "minimal" field selection level
- Increasing collection intervals:
  ```ini
  [[collection_intervals]]
      coops_water_level = 1800      # 30 minutes instead of 10
      ndbc_weather = 7200          # 2 hours instead of 1
  ```

**Balance responsiveness vs usage:**
- **Tide monitoring**: 10-30 minute intervals work well
- **Marine weather**: 1-2 hour intervals sufficient for most needs
- **Tide predictions**: 6-12 hour intervals (predictions change slowly)

### Custom Update Intervals

After installation, you can adjust data collection timing in `weewx.conf`:

```ini
[MarineDataService]
    enable = true
    
    [[collection_intervals]]
        coops_water_level = 600        # 10 minutes (600 seconds)
        coops_predictions = 21600      # 6 hours
        ndbc_weather = 3600           # 1 hour
```

### Multiple Station Management

The extension handles multiple stations automatically, but you can prioritize them:

```ini
[MarineDataService]
    [[selected_stations]]
        [[[coops_stations]]]
            9410230 = true    # Primary: La Jolla, CA
            9410580 = true    # Backup: Newport Beach, CA
        [[[ndbc_stations]]]
            46087 = true      # Primary: Offshore buoy
            46025 = true      # Backup: Coastal buoy
```
